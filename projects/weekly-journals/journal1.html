						<p class="card-text">
						So I know this is the first which means you're probably looking forward to some real long or motivational post to kick things off, but
						honestly I'd rather just keep this one short.
						</br></br>
						I'm feeling pretty motivated this week (which you can probably tell from me setting this all up) -- definitely a good thing, because
						I've definitely been losing motivation to improve myself and really lock down on as many opportunities I have right now. Grinding is the
						way that I've been fending off FOMO, so my lack of motivation has also been starting to contribute to a downward spiral of feeling worse
						and worse about myself. Definitely no good, but I was able to get in some quality me time this weekend and focus on the real goals.
						</br></br>
						I've tried to start journaling in the past with no luck, but I'm starting it back up again for two reasons:
						<ol>
							<li>I figure it'd be nice to look back on life, and</li>
							<li>I hear it's good for myself (cough yes queso) -- and I could definitely use that right now.</li>
						</ol>
						Let's start off with a list of good things so far this week! (will keep updating through the week)
						<ul>
							<li>queso</li>
							<li>did my laundry for free!</li>
							<li>washed my bedsheets for free!</li>
							<li>set this up</li>
							<li>feel decent about my readings for history right now</li>
							<li>^ set up the 10 pg paper for that!</li>
							<li>I feel more connected with luke</li>
							<li>feel more focused on what's important</li>
							<li>made a decision to not go to KASA mt and i think it was the right move</li>
							<li>saw enoch and ian this week</li>
						</ul>
						...and bad things.
						<ul>
							<li>i feel like grace and i have been getting into more moments where one of us is upset recently</li>
							<li>am still behind on history readings</li>
						</ul>
						I need to keep grinding and stay focused. I hate telling this to anyone, but I really do want to be making the most out of
						what I am able to do right now -- aka I want to be part of the elite, and I know that it's the work ethic that gets people
						there -- and I feel like who I am right now is not deserving of that. I need to keep working on cutting out FOMO from my
						life. Friends are good to have, but I shouldn't be focusing on friends if it starts becoming a timesink. Delayed gratification,
						right?
						</br></br>
						-- am out
